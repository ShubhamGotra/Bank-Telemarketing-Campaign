    "This is a supervised, classification machine learning task: given a set of data with target (in this case the subscription status) included, we want to train a model that can learn to map the features (also known as the explanatory variables) to the target. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Supervised problem: we are given both the features and the target\n",
    "* Classification problem: the target is a binary categorical variable, taking values: 0 - not subscribed to term deposit and 1 - subscribed to term deposit\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, we want the model to learn the relationship between the features and the target so we give it both the features and the answer. Then, to test how well the model has learned, we evaluate it on a testing set where it has never seen the answers! \n",

    "## Machine Learning Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the exact implementation details can vary, the general structure of a machine learning project stays relatively constant: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data cleaning and formatting\n",
    "2. Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "3. Feature engineering and selection\n",
    "4. Establish a baseline and compare several machine learning models on a performance metric\n",
    "5. Perform hyperparameter tuning on the best model to optimize it for the problem\n",
    "6. Evaluate the best model on the testing set\n",
    "7. Interpret the model results to the extent possible\n",
    "8. Draw conclusions and write a well-documented report\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up the structure of the pipeline ahead of time lets us see how one step flows into the other. However, the machine learning pipeline is an iterative procedure and so we don't always follow these steps in a linear fashion.  We may revisit a previous step based on results from further down the pipeline. For example, while we may perform feature selection before building any models, we may use the modeling results to go back and select a different set of features. Or, the modeling may turn up unexpected results that mean we want to explore our data from another angle. Generally, you have to complete one step before moving on to the next, but don't feel like once you have finished one step the first time, you cannot go back and make improvements! \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will cover the first three (and a half) steps of the pipeline with the other parts discussed in two additional notebooks. Throughout this series, the objective is to show how all the different data science practices come together to form a complete project."

    "The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Set Information\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014]\n",
    "\n",
    "2) bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "4) bank.csv with 10% of the examples and 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with less inputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM).\n",

Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.\n",

In short, the goal of EDA is to determine what our data can tell us!

    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get any further, we should define what feature engineering and selection are! These definitions are informal and have considerable overlap, but we like to think of them as two separate processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __[Feature Engineering](https://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/)__: The process of taking raw data and extracting or creating new features that allow a machine learning model to learn a mapping beween these features and the target. This might mean taking transformations of variables, such as we did with the log and square root, or one-hot encoding categorical variables so they can be used in a model. Generally, I think of feature engineering as __adding__ additional features derived from the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have explored the trends and relationships within the data, we can work on engineering a set of features for our models.In particular, we learned the following from EDA which can help us in engineering/selecting features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Age__ is not contributing significantly to term deposit , but intuitively it can be one of the important features. the reason for lack of correlation with target might be due to specificity in age numbers. Let's bin age into different age categories to generalize the data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Duration__ last contact duration is mentioned in seconds. Let's convert it into minutes in order to reduce the bandwidth of duration values which would make them more comprehensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __P-Days__ implies number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted). This feature can be used to create a new generalized feature- whether the customer was contacted for previous campaign or not ie.,(if pdays=999 then 0 else 1)"

In feature selection, we remove features that do not help our model learn the relationship between features and the target. This can help the model generalize better to new data and results in a more interpretable model. Generally, feature selection can be thought of as __subtracting__ features so we are left with only those that are most important.\n",

    "In this notebook, we carried out the first three [steps of a machine learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-7-steps-of-machine-learning-2877d7e5548e?gi=30cd995093a9) problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cleaned and formatted the raw data \n",
    "2. Performed an exploratory data analysis\n",
    "3. Developed a set of features to train our model using feature engineering and feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "We also completed the crucial task of establishing a baseline metric so we can determine if our model is better than guessing! \n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, you are starting to get a sense of how each part of the pipeline flows into the next: cleaning the data and getting it into the proper format allows us to perform an exploratory data analyis. The EDA then informs our decisions in the feature engineering and selection stage. These three steps generally are performed in this order, although we may come back later and do more EDA or feature engineering based on our modeling results. Data science is an iterative process in which we are always looking for ways to improve our previous work. This means we do not have to get things perfect the first time (although we can try our best) because there are almost always opportunities to revisit our decisions once we know more about the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part two, we will focus on implementing several machine learning methods, selecting the best model, and optimizing it for our problem using hyperparameter tuning with cross validation. As a final step here, we will save the datasets we developed to use again in the next part. "
